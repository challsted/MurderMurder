# MurderMurder
A game written in Python to be played in a Linux Console. 

## History
I have been planning this game for close to a year, but never had the skills or time to sit down and do it. 

It was originally prototyped in shell, but quickly fell on its face when I realized just how much it was going to be nested to make 1 simple thing happen. 

I'm not in the process of learning Python, and Exercise 36 of Learn Python The Hard Way is to create a game with the exact type of choices and paths I have been planning! So what better way to do this then start it in a language I like a lot, is versatile enough to do what I need it to, and is FUN to write as well as play!
